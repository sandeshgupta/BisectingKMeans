# BisectingKMeans


- Implement the Bisecting K-Means algorithm.
- Deal with text data (news records) in document-term sparse matrix format.
- Design a proximity function for text data.
  - Think about the Curse of Dimensionality.
- Think about best metrics for evaluating clustering solutions.


The train.dat file is a simple CSR sparse matrix containing the features associated
with different feature ids and their counts in the input file. (Each line represents a
document. Each pair of values within a line represent the term id and its count in
that document)
